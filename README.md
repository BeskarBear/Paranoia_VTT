# Paranoia VTT System

This is a Foundry VTT system for Paranoia based on the Core Rulebook 07-01-25.

## Install Locally

1. Copy this folder into your Foundry systems directory, e.g.
   `/home/beskarbear/.local/share/FoundryVTT/Data/systems/paranoia-vtt`
2. Launch Foundry and enable the system when creating a world.

## Features

- Troubleshooter and NPC actor types
- Core stats, skills, wounds, and treason flags
- NODE-based rolls with Computer Die support
- Item types for Equipment, Mutant Powers, Secret Societies, and Coretech
- Automatic compendium seeding on first world load

## Compendiums

On first world load, the system creates world compendiums:

- Paranoia Equipment
- Paranoia Mutant Powers
- Paranoia Secret Societies
- Paranoia Coretech & Apps
- Paranoia NPCs (templates)
- Paranoia NPC Tables (Quirks, Looks, Plans)

These are stored in the world (not the system) so you can edit them safely.
